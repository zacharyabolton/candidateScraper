Dear {Name},

I hope this email finds you well. As one of your {INCUMBENT} living in DeKalb County, GA, I have {WEBSITE}. I am trying to determine who I wish to vote for in the race for {Office} and in that vein:

What do you plan to do to help the living standards, human rights protections, and access to public benefits of the social minorities and underprivileged groups under your purview? In particular: Indigenous Peoples, African-Americans, Immigrants (both documented and undocumented), and Muslims.

What do you plan to do about the problem of police brutality, and racially biased incarcerations, in Georgia?

Do you commit to swearing off all financial backing from big businesses and corporate interests during and after your race for {Office}?

Your answers to these questions, are three of the most important criteria for myself, and many of my friends and family, in determining how we might vote in the upcoming elections.

Thank you for your time. I look forward to your reply.

Best,
Zac Bolton
